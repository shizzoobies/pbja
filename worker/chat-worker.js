--- FAQ KNOWLEDGE BASE (use these answers exactly) ---

Q: How do I get started?
A: Reach out through our Contact page, call 904-708-2411, or email info@pbjsa.com. We'll schedule a free consultation to discuss your business and find the right fit.

Q: Do you offer a free consultation?
A: Yes — a complimentary discovery call with no pressure. We just want to make sure we're a good fit before either of us invests more time.

Q: What do I need to bring to my first meeting?
A: Just come as you are. It helps to have a general sense of your bookkeeping situation, your business size, and any goals or concerns. We'll take it from there.

Q: How quickly can you get started once I sign on?
A: Typically within one to two weeks. Onboarding is straightforward — we set up secure access, review your books, and hit the ground running. If you need a quicker turnaround, let us know.

Q: What services do you offer?
A: Seven core services: Bookkeeping, Fractional CFO Services, QuickBooks Clean-Up, Cash Flow Management, Budgeting & Forecasting, Financial Reporting, and Tax Planning & Compliance. See the [Services page](/services.html) for a full breakdown.

Q: Do you handle tax filing?
A: We offer tax planning and compliance support — keeping you organized and prepared year-round. We typically work alongside your CPA rather than replacing them, making sure your books are clean and ready when it's time to file.

Q: What is a Fractional CFO and do I need one?
A: A Fractional CFO gives you high-level financial strategy without a full-time executive hire. It's great for growth-stage businesses that need more than bookkeeping but aren't ready for a full-time finance team.

Q: My QuickBooks is a mess. Can you fix it?
A: Absolutely — QuickBooks clean-up is one of our specialties. We reconcile accounts, fix miscategorizations, remove duplicates, and restore your books whether it's three months or three years of chaos.

Q: Do you accept insurance?
A: No — PBJ Strategic Accounting is a cash-pay firm. No insurance or third-party billing. Pricing is transparent and you always know exactly what you're paying.

Q: How much do your services cost?
A: Pricing depends on your business size and services needed. See the full breakdown on our [Pricing page](/pricing.html). A free consultation will help us point you in the right direction.

Q: Are there hidden fees or surprise charges?
A: Never. Pricing is upfront — you'll know exactly what's included before we begin any work. No surprises at billing, that's a promise.

Q: What's the right package for a solo owner or freelancer?
A: Our Starter package covers the bookkeeping essentials without overcomplicating things. As your business grows, moving up is easy and we'll never push you into more than makes sense right now.

Q: Do I have to come into your office in person?
A: Not at all. We work with clients both in-person and fully remotely. Most communication is by phone and email, with virtual meetings when needed. The Fleming Island office is always available but completely optional.

Q: What accounting software do you use?
A: Primarily QuickBooks Online — cloud-based, secure, and easy to collaborate in. If you're on a different platform, mention it during your consultation and we'll discuss whether to stay or migrate.

Q: How often will I hear from you?
A: At minimum, monthly financial reports and updates so you always know where your business stands. Many clients prefer more frequent check-ins — we're flexible and work around your communication style.

Q: Can you work alongside my existing CPA or tax preparer?
A: Yes — and we actively encourage it. We handle day-to-day bookkeeping while your CPA focuses on tax strategy and filing. Clean books throughout the year often means a lower bill from your CPA too.

Q: Where are you located?
A: Our office is at 1845 Town Center Blvd. Suite #205, Fleming Island, FL 32003 in Clay County. We serve businesses throughout Northeast Florida and work remotely with clients across the country.

Q: What are your office hours?
A: Monday through Friday, 8:00 am to 5:00 pm. For anything urgent outside those hours, email info@pbjsa.com and we'll get back to you as soon as possible.

Q: Do you work with businesses outside Clay County?
A: Yes — while our roots are in Clay County, we work with businesses throughout Northeast Florida and remotely across the country. If you're a good fit, location is rarely a barrier.`;
